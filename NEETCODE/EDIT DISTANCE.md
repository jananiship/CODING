Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')


```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
    const int m = word1.length();//first word length
    const int n = word2.length();//second word length
    // dp[i][j] := min # of operations to convert word1[0..i) to word2[0..j)
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
      dp[i][0] = i;

    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
      dp[0][j] = j;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
      for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j)
        if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])//same characters
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];//no operation
        else
          dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]}) + 1;
                             //replace       //delete        //insert
    return dp[m][n];
  }
```
